Change history

21 Apr 98  PRF
           prfl_specification Increased the resolution of the beta and hprime
                              stored in the prfl_id.
16 May 98  GRF
           grf_cntr_flag      New routine; renamed from GRF_CNTR_CELL.
           grf_cntr_cell      New routine to find exits from a cell.
                              Extracted from GRF_CNTR_SEARCH.
27 May 98  GRF
           grf_cntr           Call to GRF_CNTR_CELL to ensure that an interior
                              cell actually has exits before starting a contour
                              trace; removed adjustment of contour levels when
                              grid points have the same values as the contours.

           grf_cntr_edge      Corrections for grid points having the same values
                              as the contour level.

           grf_cntr_search    Changes to allow grid values to be the same as
                              contour levels; additional tests to properly
                              handle cells with no exits (like when the contour
                              closes at the entrance cell).
15 Aug 98  LIB
           read_c_grd         New routine to read C-Binary files.

           PLT
           plt_read_noise,    Added C-Binary format; improved error tests and
           plt_read_signal    messages.

25 Aug 98  GRF
           grf_cntr_trace     New contour routine; consolidates common code from
                              GRF_CNTR and GRF_CNTR_HOLES.
           grf_cntr,          Modified to use GRF_CNTR_TRACE.
           grf_cntr_holes

06 Sep 98  LWF
           lw_full_mc         Added test to delete modes near (90,0).

           SWG
           sw_iterat          Modifed test for adjusting BOTHT to abort the
                              routine if the initial value of F does not satisfy
                              the tolerance, which has been changed to 0.5 from
                              the previous value of 0.1.
           sw_wvgd            Added test to delete modes near (90,0).

           WFD
           wf_itrate          Modifed test for adjusting BOTHT to to abort the
                              routine if the initial value of F does not satisfy
                              the tolerance.

13 Sep 98  LWF                Changed test on nearly identical modes for
           lw_fast_mc         calculations across slab boundaries.

08 Feb 99  LWP
           lwp_driver         When we want to continue using the original
                              solutions from MF_DRIVER, we must recalculate
                              them because the list may have been modified
                              by SW_STEP.
